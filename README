An exercise in creating a JS application without using any modern framework. Not
because of minimalism but for the sake of curiosity and getting some in-depth
knowledge of JS which I still lack after lots of years of using it.

You are free to use, modify, copy, distribute or rewrite the code in any way you
want. No license bullshit, we're hackers, not lawyers.
